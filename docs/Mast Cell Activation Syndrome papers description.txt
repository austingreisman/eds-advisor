Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) is a complex condition characterized by abnormal mast cell activation, leading to a variety of symptoms affecting multiple organ systems. Diagnosis of MCAS is challenging due to its heterogeneity and lack of definitive laboratory tests. Two principal proposals for diagnostic criteria exist, with "consensus-2" being endorsed by a larger group of investigators. Treatment typically involves antihistamines, MC-stabilizing drugs, lifestyle modifications, and individualized management approaches. Patients with MCAS may react to medication excipients and certain foodstuffs, necessitating tailored drug treatments and elimination diets. Vigilance for signs of anaphylaxis is crucial in the perioperative setting, with prompt administration of epinephrine recommended. Overall, a comprehensive and individualized approach to diagnosis and management is essential for effectively addressing MCAS
