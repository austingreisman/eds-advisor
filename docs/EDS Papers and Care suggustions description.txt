The information discussed various aspects of joint hypermobility, particularly in the context of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS). Studies highlighted the association between adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and generalised joint hypermobility (GJH), emphasizing the need for further research to understand the underlying mechanisms. The Beighton Score (BS) was evaluated for its reliability in assessing joint hypermobility, with limitations noted in detecting generalized joint hypermobility in adults. Management of EDS and hEDS involves physical therapy, pain medication, and tailored treatments for associated symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in individuals with hypermobility spectrum disorders, necessitating an integrated multidisciplinary approach for diagnosis and management. Additionally, small fiber neuropathy (SFN) was identified as a common feature in adults with EDS, highlighting the burden of extra-articular manifestations in these individuals
