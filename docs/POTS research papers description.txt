The information provided discusses the diagnosis and treatment of Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia (IST), and Vasovagal Syncope. Diagnostic criteria, investigations like tilt-table testing, and treatment options including lifestyle changes, medications like midodrine, and physical counterpressure maneuvers are outlined. Lifestyle modifications, pharmacologic interventions, and, in select cases, device therapy are recommended for managing vasovagal syncope. Intermittent intravenous saline infusions have shown to significantly reduce symptoms and improve quality of life in patients with medication-refractory POTS. A study evaluated the prevalence of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) in individuals with POTS, revealing a high prevalence of joint hypermobility and hEDS in this population.
